BungeeFoundation is a library for bootstrapping BungeeCord plugins.

## Using

1. Install BungeeFoundation as a dependency from our [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#kangarko/bungeefoundation/):
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.kangarko</groupId>
  <artifactId>BungeeFoundation</artifactId>
  <version>REPLACE_WITH_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Relocate BungeeControl when shading. Here is a snippet for Maven to place inside <plugins> section. You need to change the shadedPattern to match your own package name.
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.4</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>shade</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <createDependencyReducedPom>false</createDependencyReducedPom>
    <artifactSet>
      <includes>
        <include>org.mineacademy:BungeeFoundation*</include>
      </includes>
    </artifactSet>
    <relocations>
      <relocation>
        <pattern>org.mineacademy</pattern>
        <shadedPattern>your.package.name.lib</shadedPattern>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>your.package.name.*</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </relocation>
    </relocations>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```
3. Make your main class extend SimplePlugin from Foundation. [See this sample implementation](https://bitbucket.org/kangarko/bungeecontrol/src/master/src/main/java/org/mineacademy/bungeecontrol/BungeeControl.java) for how it works.
